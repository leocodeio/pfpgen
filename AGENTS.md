## üöÄ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (5-10 minutes)

**Environment Configuration:**
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Install core dependencies for image processing, authentication, and UI components
3. Configure environment variables for external services
4. Set up database schema and authentication providers

**Key Dependencies to Install:**
- Core: `@prisma/client`, `prisma`, `@better-auth/core`, `@better-auth/prisma`
- Image Processing: `sharp`, `react-dropzone`, `@vercel/blob`, `axios`, `form-data`
- Canvas/Editing: `konva`, `react-konva`, `use-image`, `fabric`, `react-color`
- UI Components: All essential shadcn/ui components (buttons, cards, tabs, sliders, etc.)

### Phase 2: Backend Architecture

**Image Processing Pipeline:**
- Implement background removal using Remove.bg API integration
- Create advanced background replacement system (solid colors, gradients, patterns, custom images)
- Build comprehensive image adjustment engine (brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, sharpening, blur, gamma correction)
- Develop professional filter presets (vintage, dramatic, soft, black & white, warm, cool, professional)
- Design shape cropping system with custom SVG masks (circle, square, heart, star)
- Create social media template engine for platform-specific optimization

**Core Processing Functions Needed:**
- `removeBackground()` - API integration for background removal
- `addBackground()` - Advanced background replacement with multiple types
- `applyImageAdjustments()` - Comprehensive adjustment pipeline
- `applyFilter()` - Professional filter application
- `cropToShape()` - Custom shape cropping with SVG masks
- `applySocialTemplate()` - Platform-specific optimization

### Phase 3: Authentication & Database

**User Management System:**
- Configure Better Auth with Google OAuth provider
- Design minimal but effective database schema
- Implement user credit system (5 free images, unlimited for Pro users)
- Track processed images for user dashboard
- Set up session management and security

**Required Database Models:**
- User model with credits and plan tracking
- ProcessedImage model for user gallery
- Standard Better Auth models (Account, Session)

### Phase 4: Frontend Architecture

**Page Structure:**
- **Landing Page**: Hero section, feature showcase, authentication
- **Editor Page**: Upload interface, real-time editing canvas, tabbed controls
- **Dashboard**: User gallery, usage statistics, account management
- **Pricing**: Plan comparison and upgrade flow

**Editor Interface Design:**
- Upload area with drag-and-drop functionality
- Real-time canvas preview using Konva.js
- Tabbed editing panel:
  - Background tab: Color picker, gradient selector, pattern options
  - Adjustments tab: Sliders for all image parameters
  - Filters tab: Professional preset grid
  - Crop tab: Shape selection and social media templates
- Processing indicators and download options

### Phase 5: API Development

**Essential API Endpoints:**
- `/api/upload` - Image upload to blob storage
- `/api/process` - Main processing pipeline orchestration
- `/api/auth/[...better-auth]` - Authentication handling
- `/api/templates` - Social media template management

**Processing Pipeline Logic:**
- Accept image URL and processing operations array
- Execute operations in sequence (background removal ‚Üí background addition ‚Üí adjustments ‚Üí filters ‚Üí cropping)
- Return processed image URL and operation metadata

### Phase 6: Advanced UI Components

**Core Editor Component:**
- Interactive canvas with real-time preview
- State management for all editing parameters
- Operation queuing and processing status
- Download functionality with format options

**Professional Controls:**
- Custom slider components for precise adjustments
- Color picker with professional palette
- Filter preview grid with visual indicators
- Shape selection with visual guides
- Social media template selection with size badges

### Phase 7: Payment Integration

**Polar Integration:**
- Connect payment system to Better Auth
- Implement credit tracking and plan management
- Create upgrade flow for Pro features
- Handle payment webhooks and plan updates

### Phase 8: Deployment & Production

**Vercel Deployment:**
- Configure environment variables for production
- Set up Neon database connection
- Deploy with proper domain configuration
- Monitor performance and usage
